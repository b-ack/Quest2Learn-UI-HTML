# Quest2Learn-UI-HTML
# Here, I've created a list of HTML and initial CSS files to become more familiar with the coding of the slides in front end work. 
# My next planned project to then put this into React is to code it in C# via unity, which I will be working with Siddharth and other frontend devs for.

# Note: Each of the dashes (-) are indicators of different frames in the screen.
#       Each of the files have been added into the main branch at once as they are finished. Please let me know if you need an updated file set and I will be sure to upload them right away!
